# Mobile First - Code 301, Day 3

**Author**: Adrian Hawk and Catherine Looper

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Our goal is to create a responsive web site that changes when the viewport is at a certain width, in order to maximum user experience on mobile and desktop devices. Our design had to match comp images provided to us.

## Getting Started
A user would not have to build this app on their own machine. They can just access it once it is deployed on the web via a URL in their browser, and the product will display and respond to the user's viewport.

## Architecture
We approached this design with a mobile first mindset. Then we used media queries to adjust the design for viewports wider than 640px. We are using HTML and CSS, as well as normalize.css and the icomoon hamburger menu icon.

## Change Log
10-25-17 9:00AM - We started working on the lab and created our directory structure with Catherine as driver and Adrian as navigator. We started to code the mobile design.
